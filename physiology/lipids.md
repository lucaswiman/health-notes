# Lipids


## Cholesterol

[Cholesterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol) is a nonpolar substance which is used:
1. In the formation of animal cell membranes.
2. In the synthesis of hormones ([steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_hormone), including stress hormones, sex hormones).
3. In the synthesis of vitamin D. (A provitamin is synthesized which turns into vitamin D when exposed to UV.)
3. As a constituent of [bile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile), a digestive surfactant which aids in absorption of nonpolar nutrients (lipids).

Plants and fungi also have cholesterol-like compounds which serve similar physiological purposess:
* [Phytosterols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytosterol) and related compounds like phytostenols.
* [Ergosterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosterol), which can be a provitamin for vitamin D2.

### Synthesis and metabolism

Cholesterol is synthesized in most (all?) cells in the body.
It can also be absorbed via the digestive tract.
Most cholesterol absorbed this way is re-absorbed bile, which is why dietary cholesterol has minimal impact on blood lipid levels.
<!-- TODO: Add subsection of rough quantities of flux through the digestive tract. -->
It can also be synthesized in the liver, either for use as bile or to be transported throughout the body in lipoproteins.

## Fats

Fats are composed carboxylic acid molecules called "fatty acids", of the form R-COOH, where R is a hydrocarbon chain, with single or double bonds between the carbons in the chain.
They are usually stored with esther bonds between each of the three alcohol groups on glycerol attached to a fatty acid.
This is called a "trigyceride". 
Fatty acids with no C=C double bonds are called "saturated" (every carbon locus is saturated with hydrogen).
Fatty acids are called mono-unsaturated or poly-unsaturated (pufa) if 1 or more locus has a C=C double bond.
The carbon furthest from the carboxylic group acid is called the "methyl", omega- or n- carbon.
Carbons are then counted from that point, 1-indexed, so that the methyl carbon is n-1.
Similarly, the first C-C bond is called omega-1.
The final carbon closest to the COOH group is called the "alpha" carbon.

### Metabolism

Triglycerides are broken down in the digestive tract into their constituent parts and absorbed into the bloodstream via the hepatic portal vein.
Fatty acids are transported via serum albumin, a similar protein to the albumin in eggs.
Some triglycerides are absorbed directly into the blood (e.g. MCTs), and those are transported with lipoproteins like VLDL.

### Saturated fats

[Saturated fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturated_fat) are determined by the number of carbon molecules in their hydrocarbon chain.
They tend to have higher melting points than unsaturated fats.

Increased consumption of long-chain saturated fats is associated with increased LDL levels, though this may only apply to larger fatty acids.
For that reason, they are generally considered undesirable for people with atherosclerotic risk factors.

#### Medium-chain fatty acids
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) do not seem to affect LDL-C levels [citation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34255085/).

#### Short-chain Fatty acids
[Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-chain_fatty_acid) may be health-promoting, though they are usually not consumed directly.
SCFAs are produced by gut bacteria, and it is difficult to separate the effects of SCFAs from the effects of having a microbiome that produces them [Citation needed].
Some of their positive effects may be related to reduced inflammation

### Monounsaturated fats

### Omega-3 fatty acids

[Omega-3 fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid) have a double bond at the omega-3 position, between the omega-3 and omega-4 carbons, and no double bonds past that point. The most important omega-3 fatty acids are:
* [Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91-Linolenic_acid)
* [Eicosapenaenoic acid (EPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid)
* [Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid)
