# Cardiovascular Disease

The primary concern for middle-aged males with hypertension and high LDL-C is atherosclerosic plaque formation restricting blood supply to critical areas. The most important are coronary arteries (heart attack) and arteries in the brain (stroke).

## Atherosclerosis

This is hardening and thickening of arteries, caused by buildup of "plaques".
Plaques are caused by deposition of oxidized LDL (in particular APOb) into the arterial wall.
Over time, arteries (and especially plaques) become "calcified".
This narrows the arteries, and makes them less elastic.
If a plaque or clot detaches, it can block a clogged artery, leading to heart attack or stroke.

There are some feedback loops that cause this problem to get worse over time:
1. Harder arteries increase systolic blood pressure as blood vessels near the heart cannot expand and contract as much with each beat.
   Blood pressure physically forces LDL particles further into the arterial lining, which speeds up the hardening of the arteries.
2. One of the purposes of LDL-C is to bring cholesterol to inflamed tissue where it can be used in an immune response or tissue repair.
   Arterial plaques become inflamed, leading to an increase in the amount of LDL-C
