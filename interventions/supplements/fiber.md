## [Fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fiber)

There is an enormous amount of evidence that fiber is good for you.
There are some important distinctions between kinds of fiber:
* Insoluble fiber.
* Soluble fiber:
  * Fermentable/prebiotic fiber
  * Non-fermentable fiber
* Bulking fiber (which can be soluble or insoluble).

The most important effects of fiber are:
* Microbiome health.
  Certain kinds of prebiotic fiber promote microbes associated with health; notable inulin and larger oligofructose fibers.
  These cause the production of short-chain fatty acids, and may reduce inflammation.
  In some people they cause IBD and/or flatulence, but that seems to be the main issue with them.
* Cholesterol.
  Several kinds of fibers (most notably beta-glucan in oats/barley and psyllium) reduce the amount of cholesterol that absorbed back into the gut.
  This can reduce the amount of cholesterol entering the hepatic portal and therefore lowers production of LDL production by the liver.
* Nutrient absorption.
* Fermentation to produce nutrients, notably vitamin K and SCFAs.
* Satiety.
  Bulking fibers increase the release of GLP-1, the same hormone stimulated by semaglutide/wegovy.
* Blood sugar.
  Eating starches with fiber, expecially in the form of whole foods, reduces glycemic index.


From various sources, it seems that a wide variety of plants with fiber are desirable.

In addition to a diet rich in plants, it is probably beneficial to supplement with:
* Flax (for ALA and soluble bulking fiber)
* Psyllium (soluble bulking fiber fiber)
* Inulin and dextrin (for microbiome health)

This is preferably done before meals to reduce consumption at meals.
Supplements are not a replacement for fiber-rich foods, but are probably benficial for weight managment and controlling blood lipid levels.
